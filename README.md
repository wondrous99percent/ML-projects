Hello everyone,My name is Shivendra Pandey and I an a cse undergrad,
machine learning is a very important skill,and in today's world 
it's in demand.I have created this repository to help students who want to learn machine learning
and those who are in final year of engineering and looking for some cool projects.
Machine Learning has lots of aspect in today's world and it seems to be little bit tough to 
understand,Hence I created projects who not omly help you to understand how it works but also help in your projects.
Thanks You everyone.
